## Purpose

In this lab you will gain experience with Spring Boot Actuator and its
features.

## Learning Outcomes

You will learn how to:

- Configure Spring Boot Actuator

- Expose some or all Actuator endpoints

- Define custom metrics

- Extend the _/actuator/health_ endpoint to add custom health checks

You will be using the _44-actuator_ project.

Estimated time to complete:
45 minutes.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites are included as part of the
_Introduction to the Spring Professional Learning Path_ course
_Lab Setup_ lesson.

If you already completed it,
you should be ready to do this lab.
If not,
assuming you already have JDK 11 or 17 installed and Java IDE,
you will need to do the following:

1.  Download the **[lab codebase zip file](https://github.com/spring-academy/spring-pro-code/releases/download/core-spring-release-1.18.1/core-spring-labfiles.zip)**.

2.  Once you have downloaded the file, unzip it under
    a directory of your choice.
    The unzipped directory `core-spring-labfiles/lab`
    contains the lab projects.

3.  Run `./mvnw clean install`
    (if you plan on using Maven as your build tool).

## Use Case

All production applications should have health monitoring, and will
often need metric gathering.
Actuator gives us both of these.
You will be enabling actuator in your project and implementing mechanisms
to provide an additional custom metric to indicate the number of times
Account details have been requested.
Additionally, you will be creating a custom HealthIndicator and adding
that to the overall health status that is obtained.

## Instructions

### Enable Actuator

**TODO-01** : Check dependencies

1.  In the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` for the `actuator` project,
    look for TODO-01.
    We have added the dependency on the Spring Boot Actuator starter.

**TODO-02** : Review application

1.  Run the application and using a browser that can display JSON
    (Firefox, Chrome), open
    [http://localhost:8080/actuator/](http://localhost:8080/actuator/)
    and explore the links.

    - If you prefer you can use `curl` or `Postman` to examine the
      links referred to in this lab.

1.  Now visit the
    [http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics](http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics)
    endpoint.

    You will see an error on this page.
    Even though there are many
    [valid endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-endpoints),
    only the `health` endpoint is automatically exposed in Actuator.

### Expose Actuator Endpoints

**TODO-03** Expose HTTP actuator endpoints.

1.  In the `application.properties` file, expose the
    `metrics` and `beans` endpoints by setting the appropriate Spring
    Boot property.

    - These are two of the
      [many endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-endpoints)
      that can be exposed.

1.  Once the application restarts, visit the
    [http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics](http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics) endpoint
    again.
    Now you will see a list of all the metrics tracked by Actuator.

    Try fetching the data for one of the metrics by constructing a url
    based on the name of the metric.
    For example, visit
    [http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max](http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max).

1.  View the beans our application has loaded by visiting
    [http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans](http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans).

**TODO-04** Expose all HTTP actuator endpoints.

1.  Modify the property again to expose _all_ actuator endpoints.
    Once the application restarts, visit the following endpoints:

    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans](http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans)
    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/health](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health)
    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/info](http://localhost:8080/actuator/info)
    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/mappings](http://localhost:8080/actuator/mappings)
    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers](http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers)
    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max](http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max)

2.  Use tags with `metrics` endpoint

    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests](http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests)
    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests?tag=method:GET](http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests?tag=method:GET)
    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests?tag=uri:/actuator/beans](http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests?tag=uri:/actuator/beans)

3.  Access some URL endpoints that are not existent and get metrics on them.

    - [http://localhost:8080/notexistent](http://localhost:8080/notexistent)
    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests?tag=status:404](http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests?tag=status:404)

### Change Logging Level

**TODO-05** Change log level via `./actuator/loggers` endpoint

1.  Display logging level of `account.web` package

    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/accounts.web](http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/accounts.web)

    Observe that the `effectiveLevel` is currently set to `DEBUG`

    ```json
    {
      "configuredLevel": null,
      "effectiveLevel": "DEBUG"
    }
    ```

1.  Add a log statement as shown below to the `accountSummary()` method of the controller

    ```java
    @GetMapping(value = "/accounts")
    public @ResponseBody List<Account> accountSummary() {
       logger.debug("Logging message within accountSummary()"); // add this line
       return accountManager.getAllAccounts();
    }
    ```

1.  Once the application restarts, access `/accounts` url and verify that
    the log message gets displayed

1.  Change the logging level to `INFO` using either `curl` or `Httpie` or `Postman`

    ```bash
    curl -i -XPOST -H"Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/accounts.web -d'{"configuredLevel": "INFO"}'
    ```

    ```bash
    http post localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/accounts.web configuredLevel=INFO
    ```

1.  Verify that the `effectiveLevel` of the `accounts.web` package is now
    changed to `INFO`

    ```json
    {
      "configuredLevel": "INFO",
      "effectiveLevel": "INFO"
    }
    ```

1.  Access `/accounts` url again and verify that the log message no longer
    gets displayed

### Publish Build Information

Spring Boot Actuatorâ€™s `info` endpoint publishes information about your
application specified in the
`META-INF/build-info.properties` file.

The `META-INF/build-info.properties` can be created by the
Spring Boot Maven or Gradle Plugin during build

**TODO-06** Add Maven goal or Gradle task

1.  If you are using Maven, add `build-info` goal

    ```xml
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>build-info</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
    ```

    if you are using Gradle, add `BuildInfo` task

    ```groovy
    springBoot  {
        buildInfo()
    }
    ```

1.  Rebuild the application preferably at the command line

    ```bash
    ./mvnw -pl 00-rewards-common -pl 01-rewards-db -pl 44-actuator clean install
    ```

    ```bash
    ./gradlew 44-actuator:clean 44-actuator:build
    ```

1.  Verify that `target/classes/META-INF/build-info.properties` (for Maven) or
    `build/resources/main/META-INF/build-info.properties` (for Gradle) is created
    with build information

1.  Visit `info` endpoint and verify that the build info
    gets displayed

**TODO-07: Optional** Add additional properties to the info endpoint

1.  Expose the Java runtime information. The Java info contributor is disabled by default, enable it by adding the following property in the `application.properties`

    ```properties
    management.info.java.enabled=true
    ```

1.  Add some custom properties to the `application.properties`

    ```properties
    management.info.env.enabled=true
    info.restaurant.location=New York
    info.restaurant.discountPercentage=10
    ```

1.  Rebuild the application

1.  Visit `info` endpoint and verify that additional
    properties are displayed

### Define Custom Metrics - Counter

By default, Actuator exposes a number of useful but rather generic
metrics.
Often tracking metrics that are specific to your application's domain
provides insights into operational, business, or other concerns.

Let's add a custom metric specific to our application that counts
the number of times the account finder method is used.

**TODO-08** : Add a counter with a tag

1.  In the constructor of `AccountController`, add an instance of
    `MeterRegistry` as a second parameter.

1.  Using the `MeterRegistry`, create a Counter called `account.fetch`
    with a tag of `type`/`fromCode` key/value pair by
    calling `meterRegistry.counter("account.fetch", "type", "fromCode");`.

1.  Store the counter as a new data-member.

**TODO-09** : Use the counter

1. In the `accountDetails()` method, call `increment()` on the Counter.

**TODO-10** : Run the test

1.  Verify that the tests in `AccountControllerTests` pass.
    Particularly the `testHandleDetailsRequest()`, which checks that
    the counter is working correctly.

**TODO-11** : Verify the result

1.  Once the application restarts, visit the
    [(http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics](http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics)
    endpoint again.
    You should now see `account.fetch` listed.

1.  Visit the
    [http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/account.fetch](http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/account.fetch)
    to view the data for your counter.
    This should display 0 since no accounts have been fetched yet.

1.  Fetch an account by visiting
    [http://localhost:8080/accounts/1](http://localhost:8080/accounts/1).

1.  Visit the
    [(http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/account.fetch](http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/account.fetch)
    again, verify that the counter increase with each account fetch.

    Try restarting your application.
    What happens to the counter?

### Define Custom Metrics - Timer

**TODO-12** : Add timer using @Timed annotation

1.  Add the following annotation to the `accountSummary(..)` method.

    ```java
    @Timed(value="account.timer", extraTags = {"source", "accountSummary"})
    ```

1.  Add the following annotation to the `accountDetails(..)` method.

    ```java
    @Timed(value="account.timer", extraTags = {"source", "accountDetails"})
    ```

**TODO-13** : Verify the result

1.  Once the application restarts, visit the [localhost:8080/accounts/1](http://localhost:8080/accounts/1) and [localhost:8080/accounts](http://localhost:8080/accounts) for a few times

1.  Visit the
    [(http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/account.timer](http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/account.timer) and verify the timer metric

### Get Detail Health Checks

**TODO-14** : Add more details to the health check

1.  Visit the
    [http://localhost:8080/actuator/health](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health) endpoint.

    By default there is very little info displayed at this endpoint.

1.  In your `application.properties` file, enable more detailed health
    info by setting the `management.endpoint.health.show-details` to
    `always`.

1.  Restart the application and refresh
    [http://localhost:8080/actuator/health](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health) to see
    more health details.

### Create Custom Health Checks

You can extend the default health checks so that your application
reports whether it is down or up based on custom criteria or domain
logic.

In this case, we will determine the health of the application based on
whether there are any restaurants in the database.
If there are no restaurants, then the health status of the application
will be considered `DOWN`.

**NOTE:** Stop the `ActuatorApplication` to avoid it constantly
restarting whilst we add new classes.

**TODO-15a and TODO-15b** : Setup a test

1.  Navigate to the `src/test/java` directory.
    Inside the `accounts.web` package, there is a class called
    `RestaurantHealthCheckTest`.
    It is mostly written for you.

1.  Modify the code to use the `RestaurantHealthCheck.health()` method
    in each test.
    The code will not compile yet - we have not written the code we are
    testing.

**TODO-16a** : Implement `RestaurantHealthCheck`

1.  Navigate to the `RestaurantHealthCheck` class under
    the `accounts.web` package.

1.  Modify the class to implements the `HealthIndicator` interface.

1.  Implement the missing `health()` method with the following logic:

    - If there are one or more restaurants in the database,
      return `Health.up().build()`.

    - Otherwise return `Health.down().build()`.

    - You will need to pass the `RestaurantRepository` into this
      object via constructor injection.

**TODO-16b** : Test custom health indicator

1.  Create an instance of `RestaurantHealthCheck` class in
    the `setup` method in the `RestaurantHealthCheckTest`

1.  Remove `@Disabled` annotation from both tests

1.  Run the tests and verify they pass.

**TODO-17** : Access The Health Indicator

1.  Restart the application.

2.  Refresh the `health` endpoint.
    You should see that your application is `DOWN` because there are
    no Restaurants in the database.

**TODO-18/19** : Repeat with restaurants in the database

1.  To populate your database with a Restaurant, change the
    `application.properties` to set `spring.sql.init.data-locations` property
    with `classpath:/data-with-restaurants.sql`.

1.  Once the server restarts refresh the health endpoint.
    You should now see that your application health reports `UP`.

1.  Verify that all tests in the `actuator` project pass.

### Organize Health Indicators Into Groups

**TODO-20** : Organize Health Indicators into groups

From Spring Boot 2.2,
health indicators can be organized into groups using the format below.

```properties
management.endpoint.health.group.<group-name>.include=<list of health indicators>
```

Each group can be individually configured.

1.  Create 3 groups:
    `system`, `web`, and `application` as following:

    - The `system` group includes `diskSpace` and `db` health indicators
    - The `web` group includes `ping` health indicator
    - The `application` group includes `restaurantHealthCheck` health indicator

1.  For `system` and `application` groups, configure `show-details` with `always`

1.  Remove `management.endpoint.health.show-details=always` since it
    is no longer needed

1.  Restart the application and access the health endpoint
    per each group

    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/system](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/system)
    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/web](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/web)
    - [http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/application](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/application)

### Secure Actuator Endpoints

**TODO-21** : Add Spring Boot Security starter to the pom.xml or build.gradle file

**TODO-22** : Add security configuration

1.  The skeleton code of the security configuration class,
    `ActuatorSecurityConfiguration` is already provided.
    Uncomment the code until there is no compile errors.

**TODO-23** : Add security configuration to `ActuatorSecurityConfiguration` class

1.  Add code to provide access control to actuator endpoints

    ```java
    http.authorizeHttpRequests((authz) -> authz
                .requestMatchers(EndpointRequest.to(HealthEndpoint.class, InfoEndpoint.class)).permitAll()
                .requestMatchers(EndpointRequest.to(ConditionsReportEndpoint.class)).hasRole("ADMIN")
                .requestMatchers(EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint()).hasRole("ACTUATOR")
                .anyRequest().authenticated())
            .httpBasic(withDefaults())
            .csrf(CsrfConfigurer::disable);
    ```

**TODO-24** : Run the tests in the `AccountClientSecurityTests`

1.  Take some time to understand what each test is for

1.  Remove `@Disabled` annotation from each test and run it

1.  Make sure all tests pass

## Summary

In this lab you have configured Spring Boot Actuator.
You have also leveraged Spring Boot Actuator to give detailed
information about application metrics and customized health stats.

Congratulations, you are done with the lab.
If this were a production
application,
one logical next step would be to integrate Actuator with an external
monitoring system.

## Optional Exercises

Do the following exercises if you have an extra time.

**TODO-25 (Optional)** : Experiment with HealthIndicator

1.  Change `spring.sql.init.data-locations` property in the
    `application.properties` file back to use `classpath:data-no-restaurants.sql`.

1.  Include the restaurant count as extra detail in the health endpoint.
    Have a look at the `Health` class to see how this might work.

1.  Instead of returning `DOWN` when there are no restaurants, use a
    custom status called `NO_RESTAURANTS`.
    You will have to create `Status` object.

1.  When there are no restaurants in the DB, what top-level status
    is returned for the `application` health group?

    Fix this issue by changing
    `management.endpoint.health.group.application.status.order` property
    in the "application.properties" file so that `NO_RESTAURANTS`
    gets displayed as top-level status for the `application` health group.

1.  Restart the application and verify the result.

**TODO-26 (Optional)** : Use AOP for counting logic

If you are short on time, skip this step.

In general, mixing up different concerns (controller logic
and counter logic in this example code) is not considered
a good practice:
it violates _Single Responsibility Principle_.
Instead, usage of AOP provides cleaner code.

1.  Add `spring-boot-starter-aop` starter to the `pom.xml` or the
    `build.gradle`

1.  Create an aspect, through which `account.fetch` counter, which
    has a tag of `type`/`fromAspect` key/value pair, gets incremented
    every time `accountSummary` method of the `AccountController` class
    is invoked

1.  Access `/accounts` several times and verify the metrics of
    `/actuator/metrics/account.fetch?tag=type:fromAspect`

**TODO-27 (Optional)** : Access Actuator endpoints using JMX

If you are short on time, skip this step.

- JMX is disabled by default from Spring Boot 2.2.
  Enable it by adding the following line to the
  `application.properties` file

  ```java
  spring.jmx.enabled=true
  ```

- Restart the application

- Open a terminal window and run `jconsole`.
  Accept the insecure connection if prompted

  ![Starting JConsole](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-academy/spring-academy-assets/main/courses/course-spring-professional/jconsole-new-connection.png)

  **Figure 1:** Starting JConsole

- Select the `MBeans` tab, find the `org.springframework.boot` folder,
  then open the `Endpoint` sub-folder.
  Note that all actuator endpoints ARE exposed for JMX
