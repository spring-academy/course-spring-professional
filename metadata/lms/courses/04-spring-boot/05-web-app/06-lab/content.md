## Purpose

In this lab you will implement a Spring MVC REST Controller to fetch
account information and return results to the user.

## Learning Outcomes

What you will learn:

1.  How to set up required Spring MVC infrastructure with Spring Boot

1.  How to expose Controllers as endpoints mapped to web application
    URLs

Specific subjects you will gain experience with:

1.  Spring Boot for Web

2.  @RestController

You will be using the _36-mvc_ project.

Estimated time to complete:
20 minutes.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites are included as part of the
_Introduction to the Spring Professional Learning Path_ course
_Lab Setup_ lesson.

If you already completed it,
you should be ready to do this lab.
If not,
assuming you already have JDK 11 or 17 installed and Java IDE,
you will need to do the following:

1.  Download the **[lab codebase zip file](https://github.com/spring-academy/spring-pro-code/releases/download/core-spring-release-1.18.1/core-spring-labfiles.zip)**.

2.  Once you have downloaded the file, unzip it under
    a directory of your choice.
    The unzipped directory `core-spring-labfiles/lab`
    contains the lab projects.

3.  Run `./mvnw clean install`
    (if you plan on using Maven as your build tool).

## Use Case

For this and subsequent labs we have added account management
functionality to the Rewards application.

An `AccountManager` service-layer class has been added for fetching
account details.
Later we will extend it to support updating accounts.

The new functionality is shown inside the red dotted line in this
diagram:

## Quick Instructions

If you are already knowledgeable with the lesson concepts, you may
consider jumping right to the code, and execute the lab in form of
embedded TODO comments.
Instructions on how to view them are at the
[_Using TODO Tasks_ article](/spring-dev-tools-configuring-todos).

If you arenâ€™t sure, try the TODO instructions first and refer to the
lab instructions by TODO number if you need more help.

## Instructions

You will start with the `mvc` project.
Navigate to that project now in your IDE.

### Check the Project Is Working

**TODO-01** : Open the `pom.xml` and have a quick look at the
dependencies you are using.
In particular you should see the Spring Boot starters for:

- **Web** - This will allow Spring Boot setup the full Spring MVC
  environment for our new controller to use.

- **Devtools** - Enables automatic restart of the application whenever
  you change a Java file or resource.

- **JPA** - For convenience the AccountManager is implemented using
  JPA to access the account table in the database.

- **Mustache** - The home page is a minimal web-page just to show the
  application is working, implemented using server-side rendering and
  Mustache templates.
  No need to worry about this, it is not part of the lab.

**TODO-02** : Run the application.

- Run it as a Java or Spring Boot application.

- Once it is running navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
  You should see a page like this:

  ![Home page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-academy/spring-academy-assets/main/courses/course-spring-professional/mvc-home-page.png)

  The "_List accounts_" link does not work yet.

- If you are interested, the original HTML is in
  `src/main/resources/templates/index.html`.

### Implement a REST Controller

**TODO-03** : Make the `AccountsController` a rest controller

- This class is partially implemented for you.
  Open it now.
  Note that the `AccountManager` is already available - it will be
  injected by Spring when the controller is instantiated.

- Annotate this class so Spring MVC knows it is a controller for
  handling REST requests.

**TODO-04** : Make the `accountsList` method RESTful

- Add a mapping for `/accounts` - what HTTP method are we using?
  So what annotation should you use?

**TODO-05** : Implement the `accountsList` method

- Use the `accountManager` to fetch all the accounts and return them
  from the method.

- Save your changes and wait for the application to restart (Spring
  Boot Devtools causes the restart automatically).

- Either:

  - Return to the home-page in your browser and click on the
    "_List accounts in JSON_" link.

  - Or using curl or Postman make a GET request to
    http://localhost:8080/accounts.

- If you see the accounts in JSON format all is well.

  You might find it useful to add JSON pretty-print capability to your
  browser.

  - Chrome\: Do a search for "Chrome JSON Editor"
  - Firefox\: Enabled by default.
  - Edge\: Do a search for "JSON Formatter for Edge"
  - Internet Explorer\: No extra software is required, just a registry
    change - see https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/216175/View-JSON-in-Internet-Explorer

**TODO-06** : Stop the application

- We will be making several changes and running tests and don't need
  Devtools to keep restarting our application when we are not using it.
  _Stop the application now_.

**TODO-07** : Test the controller

- A unit test for our controller has already been written for you.
  It uses a Stub `AccountManager` managing a single test `Account`.

- Open `AccountControllerTests` and run its tests now. It should pass.

- Strictly speaking we should have tested the Controller before
  running the application, but as the application was already running
  we exercised it first.
  This is not normal development practice - _always run tests first_!

### Fetch an Individual Account

Your next task is to add a new Controller method to fetch just a single
account by its entity id, test the method works and then run the
application.

This time we will adopt a true TDD (Test Driven Development) approach.

**TODO-08** : Add a new controller method

- Add a new method `accountDetails` to the `AccountController` class.

- Implement it as described by the TODOs.
  The required entityId will
  be a URI template parameter and the URL to map is therefore
  `/accounts/{entityId}`.

**TODO-09** : Add a new test

- You should already have `AccountControllerTests` open.
  Scroll down to `testHandleDetailsRequest()` and add code to
  invoke the new method on the controller and verify the results as
  instructed by the TODOs.

**TODO-10** : Test the new controller method

- Return to `AccountControllerTests` and remove the `@Disabled`
  annotation on the `testHandleDetailsRequest()` method.

- Run the tests again.
  Both should pass.
  Make any fixes to the new `AccountController` method until the tests
  pass.

**TODO-11** : Rerun the application

- Using your IDE, run the code as a Java or Spring Boot application.

- Using your Browser, Postman or `curl` try the following URLs

  - http://localhost:8080/accounts/0
  - http://localhost:8080/accounts/1

**TODO-12** : Change port

- Go to application.properties and set the Spring Boot property to
  make the server listen on port 8088.

- Once the server restarts, try going to http://localhost:8088. If you
  can see the home page again, all is well.

Congratulations you have finished the lab.

## Summary

What have we achieved:

1.  Implemented a REST Controller.

2.  Tested it using simple JUnit unit tests.

3.  Run the application to validate it using an HTTP client.

Congratulations, you have completed the lab!
